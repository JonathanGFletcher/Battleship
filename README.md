## Game Instructions:
Before playing the game, you must create a profile and place your ships.\
\
Select option 2 in the main menu.\
First, you will be asked for a username.\
Second, you must place your ships.\
This can be done by first selecting the orientation and then selecting the coordinate to place the ship on.\
For orientation, type either H or V. For the coordinate you must type it like so, for example: C5\
The ship will be placed starting on the selected coordinate and either going right or down the coordinates for horizontal and vertical positioning respectively.\
You will be prompted to place all 5 of your ships.\
\
Select option 3 in the main menu.\
This will generate an opponent for you from random.\
\
Now, select option 1 to start the game.\
\
To start, select the coordinate opon which you would like to strike on the opponent's map.\
Once you select a coordinate, you will find out if you either hit or missed.\
Then, the opponent will take a turn and the round will again repeat.\
After playing back and forth, if you have hit all coordinates of the opponent's ships, you win the game.
